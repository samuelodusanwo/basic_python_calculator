# üêç Python Fundamentals: Basic Calculator Assignment

## Project Description
This repository contains a simple Python program developed as part of an introductory assignment to Python programming. The core of this project is a command-line calculator that takes user input for two numbers and a mathematical operation, then performs the calculation and displays the result.

## üéØ Objective
The primary objectives of this assignment were to:
* Familiarize with basic Python syntax.
* Practice declaring and using variables.
* Understand fundamental data types (specifically numbers and strings).
* Learn how to collect user input using the `input()` function.
* Perform basic arithmetic operations.
* Implement conditional logic (`if-elif-else`) for decision-making.
* Introduce basic error handling (e.g., division by zero, invalid input).

## ‚ú® Features
* **Two-Number Input:** Prompts the user to enter two numerical values.
* **Operation Selection:** Allows the user to choose between addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
* **Calculation & Output:** Performs the chosen operation and prints the result clearly.
* **Robust Input Handling:** Uses `try-except` blocks to catch non-numeric input.
* **Division by Zero Safeguard:** Prevents the program from crashing on division by zero.
* **Invalid Operation Alert:** Informs the user if an unknown operation is entered.

## üöÄ How to Run the Calculator
To run this Python calculator on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/samuelodusanwo/basic_python_calculator.git
    cd your-repo-name # Navigate into the project directory
    ```

2.  **Execute the Python Script:**
    ```bash
    python calculator.py
    ```

     **Note:** If you don't have Python installed on your machine, you'll need to download and install it first. You can find instructions and downloads on the official Python website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

3.  **Follow the Prompts:**
    The program will ask you to enter the first number, the second number, and the desired operation.

### Example Interaction:

Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): +
Result: 10.0 + 5.0 = 15.
